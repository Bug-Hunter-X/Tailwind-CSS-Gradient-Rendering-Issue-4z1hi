# Tailwind CSS Gradient Rendering Issue

This repository demonstrates a bug where Tailwind CSS gradients sometimes fail to render correctly. The gradient may not appear at all, or only a single color from the gradient might be visible.

## Bug Description

The issue occurs when using the `bg-gradient-to-*` utility classes. In some instances, the expected gradient effect is not applied, resulting in either a solid color or no visible gradient.

## Reproduction Steps

1. Clone this repository.
2. Open `bug.html` in a web browser.
3. Observe that the gradient does not render correctly.

## Solution

The solution involves ensuring that the necessary Tailwind CSS configurations and dependencies are correctly set up. This includes verifying the Tailwind directives in your CSS file and confirming that all required dependencies are properly installed. The corrected code is in `bugSolution.html`
